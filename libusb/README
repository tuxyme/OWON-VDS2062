Project https://github.com/florentbr/OWON-VDS1022 is an unofficial release for
the VDS1022 oscilloscope. The download from this site includes libusb-0.1 library
binaries for different architectures. The binaries are not included here and the
proper binary for the target system must be downloaded or installed seperately.

See linux/sources.md for complete reference to used sources.

Dependencies
============
The libusb-0.1.so.4 library is referenced during compilation. Edit the build script
for your architecture to link to the proper location. To run the software, the
library must be present on the system library path or in the VDS_S2/lib directory.

  install libusb-0.1 on Debian:
    apt-get install libusb-0.1-4
  or download and unpack from
    https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libusb-0.1-4

Compile and install
===================
> cd linux
> ./build-amd64.sh
> cp amd64/libusbJava.so ../../VDS_S2/lib/

Modification for VDS2062
========================
The VDS2062 client software sends an usb set-configuration message on every new
connection. The libusb stack on Linux relays this message to the device. After
that message the device becomes unresponsive. On Windows these configuration
messages are not present. The device worked properly after changing LibusbJava.c
to block multiple configuration messages.
