OWON VDS2064 Oscilloscope for linux
===================================

This project allows the OWON VDS2062 software to run on Linux. The VDS2062 is also
sold as Multicomp Pro MP720018 and probably under other brand names. This software
is tested on several releases of Debian and Ubuntu using a MP720018.

Installation instructions:
1) download Owon VDS2062 software
   https://www.owon.com.hk/download.asp?category=Digital%20Oscilloscope&series=VDS%20Series&model=VDS2062
2) unpack and run the windows installer (on Windows or using wine)
3) copy the resulting VDS_S2 directory to the project (this) directory
4) modify the VDS_S2 tree:
   > cd VDS_S2
   > rm launcher.exe, uninst.exe
   > rm -rf USBDRV
   > mkdir lib
   > cd plugins
   > mv */*.jar .
   - Download jre-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz from
     https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html
   - unpack and move jre1.8.0_202 to the VDS_S2 directory
5) compile and install libusbJava, see libusb/README
6) The Java class files are generated using jdk6. Install jdk6 in the project directory.
   - Download jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin from
     https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase-java-archive-javase6-downloads.html
   - move jdk1.6.0_45 to the project directory
7) run decompile.sh
8) run compile.sh
9) start the application:
   > cd VDS_S2
   > ./launch

The decompile and compile scripts are commented in hope to provide some guidance
when a script fails.

SCPI
====

The scpi folder contains the SCPILink module for communicating with the VDS2064 via SCPI. Make sure
the SCPI server is started (function menu > Utility > SCPI Console) and match the port the SCPI
server is listening on with the port in scpitest.py. Then run scpitest:
> python3 scpitest.py

When using the SCPILink module in an environment with existing event loop (eg Spyder), use nest_asyncio
as shown in spyder.py
